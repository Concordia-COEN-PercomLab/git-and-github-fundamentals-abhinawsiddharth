# My Learnings and Confusions

## Learnings

- I learned about the concept of pull requests and their role in collaborative software development.
- I understand how to create branches or forks to work on separate copies of the codebase.
- I learned how to open a pull request, provide a clear description, and engage in discussions with reviewers.

## Confusions

- I understood for the most part. However, in the future if any doughts arise I will contact you.
